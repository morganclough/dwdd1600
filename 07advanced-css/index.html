        <p>Hi! My name is Morgan, and I'm so happy you're here! I'm an artist with a passion for bringing imagination to life through my artwork. Art has been my constant companion since I could hold a crayon, and it's become the language through which I express my innermost thoughts and emotions.</p>
            
        <h2>The Journey</h2>    
        <p>My artistic journey began in my childhood, including crayon doodles on walls and sketches in notebooks. Over the years, I've explored a wide range of artistic mediums, including the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>graphite</li>
                <li>colored pencil</li>
                <li>digital illustration</li>
                <li>photography</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each medium has left its mark on my creative identity, contributing to my evolving style.</p>
            
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>    
        <p>I find inspiration all around me, but especially from media. Growing up I loved watching Disney movies. I specifically remember the colors and shapes in Disney's <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> so vividly. This led to my studying the lives of iconic artists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Blair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Blair</a>, which is where I draw a lot of my inspiration from today.<br>
            Below is a list of some other sources that have inspired me over the years:<br></p>
         <dl>
            <dt>Walt Disney</dt>
                <dd>An American film producer, director, screenwriter, voice actor, and entrepreneur who is best known for co-founding The Walt Disney Company. I've always admired Disney's creativity and passion for his work. I draw a lot of my inspiration from his ideas.</dd>
            <dt>Disneyland</dt>
                <dd>A theme park in Anaheim, CA pioneered by Walt Disney. I grew up going to Disneyland and I've always loved it. Being surrounded by creative ideas and artwork always leaves me feeling excited and inspired to create.</dd>
            <dt>The Uinta Mountains</dt>
                <dd>A chain of mountains in Utah extending a short distance into northwest Colorado and slightly into Wyoming. I also grew up going here and camping. I love nature, and being surrounded by the beauty of these mountains connects me to the world spiritually, and rejuvinates my creative mind.</dd>  
            </dl>
            
        <h2>Experiences</h2>    
        <p>My artistic journey has led to some incredible experiences. I've had the privilege of showcasing my work in various exhibitions and galleries, an experience that has allowed me to connect with art enthusiasts and fellow artists. Additionally, I've been fortunate to receive scholarships that have supported my growth as an artist and further fueled my passion.</p> 
        <p>As I continue my studies and artistic exploration, I look forward to pushing the boundaries of my creativity even further. My goal is to create art that resonates with people, stirs emotions, and sparks conversations. I believe that art has the power to inspire change and foster connections, and I'm committed to using my craft for these purposes.</p>
