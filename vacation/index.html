        <h2>Where It All Started</h2>    
        <p>Our founder, Jane Doe, had always dreamed of getting out of her small town. But one thing always held her back: the money! She found a cheap flight to Greece in 2006 and has had the travel bug ever since. She's made it her mission to help other people travel for cheap. Since 2008, weâ€™ve helped thousands of people save money, travel more, and have a more authentic experience in the destinations they visit. Some of the best deals we've helped people find include trips to the following locations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Santorini, Greece</li>
                <li>Paris, France</li>
                <li>Cancun, Mexico</li>
                <li>Sydney, Australia</li>
            </ul>
